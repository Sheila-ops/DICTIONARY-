# DICTIONARY
I make a dictionary by using a step-by-step process. First, I encode the needed data using curly brackets, and the key-value pairs are separated by the colons. I encode all the 30 terms and its definition. After encoding the 30 terms needed, the next is using the close curly bracket and encoding the a = input("EXPLAIN THE ") and the print(DATA[a]).

This is the video of making a dictionary.
